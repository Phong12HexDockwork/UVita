# 🚀 WHAT IS UVITA ?

      UVita is an innovative application designed to provide real-time UV index data to users through their smartphones. By harnessing the capabilities of UV-measuring phone cases equipped with integrated UV and light sensors, the application addresses a significant gap in public awareness regarding the harmful effects of UV radiation on skin health. In an era where outdoor activities are increasingly common, many individuals remain unaware of the risks associated with UV exposure, including skin damage and heightened risk of skin cancer. Our project aims to empower users with immediate, accurate information, enabling them to make informed decisions about sun protection and promoting overall public health.


# ⚙ HOW DOES IT WORK ?

     The UVita system operates through a seamless integration of various hardware components, ensuring reliable and accurate data transmission. The process begins when sunlight, containing UV radiation, approaches the integrated UV and light sensors located within the specially designed phone case. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how the system works:

- **ML8511 UV Sensor:** For measuring UV radiation.

- **TSL2561 Light Sensor:** For measuring ambient light conditions.

- **Arduino Pro Mini:** Central processing unit for data interpretation.

- **Bluetooth Module (e.g., HC-05):** For wireless communication with smartphones.

- **3.3V Buck-Boost Voltage Regulator:** Ensures stable voltage supply.

- **Rechargeable Battery:** Powers the entire system.
